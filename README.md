# BlinkIT Grocery Sales Analytics Dashboard (Power BI Project)
## Role: Data Analyst

This project showcases analytical work using Power BI to explore grocery retail performance for BlinkIT (India's Last Minute App). The goal was to uncover insights about sales patterns, product performance, outlet characteristics, and customer ratings across various grocery categories and store formats.

The dashboard transforms raw grocery sales data into actionable insights for business managers, category managers, and analysts — revealing sales drivers and optimization opportunities across BlinkIT's grocery operations.

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that answers critical business questions related to grocery retail performance, including:
•	Which item types and categories generate the highest sales?

•	How do sales vary across different outlet sizes and locations?

•	What are the rating patterns across product categories?

•	Which outlet types perform best in terms of sales and customer satisfaction?

•	How do fat content preferences impact sales across different outlets?

•	What are the sales trends by establishment year and outlet characteristics?
